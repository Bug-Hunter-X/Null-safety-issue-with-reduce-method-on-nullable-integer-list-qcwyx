# Null safety issue with reduce method on nullable integer list

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method with lists containing nullable integers in Dart. The `reduce` method requires a function that combines two elements of the list.  When dealing with nullable types, this function must handle the possibility of null values to avoid runtime errors.

The bug showcases how attempting to directly use the `+` operator on nullable integers (`int?`) results in a compilation error because the `+` operator isn't defined for `int?`.

The solution demonstrates how to properly handle null values within the reduce function.
